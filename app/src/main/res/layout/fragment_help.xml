If you make a mistake, don't worry! You can always edit an exercise or even delete and start over. While in the Daily View, long press on an exercise to edit details or delete. Toggling the 'Pending'/'Done' button will keep track of when an exercise is completed. Simply toggle to 'Pending' to revert an exercise to be incomplete.
            \nDay Summary- Long pressing on the summary area will allow you to edit the summary to whatever you want, such as &quot;Leg Day&quot;. Remember, bros don't let bros skip leg day!
            \n\nReports- Reports can be generated by clicking the 'Reports' button. This report will show the number of exercises in the database as well as percentage of completed exercises. It will not count exercises in future days, so have no fear! There will be an emoticon to let you know how you're doing keeping up with your goals.
            \n\nWhat's next? Get some exercise!
            \nFuture improvements for this app are planned to include a full calendar, button updates based on summary changes, and an indicator showing that a day has no exercises."
